## Introduction
Transformers are a type of machine learning model introduced in the paper "Attention Is All You Need" by Vaswani et al. They have been highly influential in the field of NLP and have set new benchmarks in a variety of tasks.

## Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of Python programming
- Familiarity with machine learning and NLP
- Installation of Python 3.x and pip

## Key Concepts

### Attention Mechanism
Attention allows the model to focus on relevant parts of the input when producing the output. It is essentially a weighted sum of the input features.

### Multi-Head Attention
This is an extension of the basic attention mechanism, allowing the model to focus on different parts of the input for different tasks or reasons.

### Encoder-Decoder Architecture
Transformers generally consist of an Encoder to process the input and a Decoder to produce the output. Some models like BERT use only the Encoder part for tasks like text classification.

## Installation

To install the Hugging Face Transformers library, run:

\`\`\`bash
pip install transformers
\`\`\`

## Hands-On Example: Text Classification

In this example, we will use the DistilBERT model for text classification.

First, import the required libraries:

\`\`\`python
from transformers import DistilBertTokenizer, DistilBertForSequenceClassification
import torch
\`\`\`

Initialize the tokenizer and model:

\`\`\`python
tokenizer = DistilBertTokenizer.from_pretrained('distilbert-base-uncased')
model = DistilBertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained('distilbert-base-uncased')
\`\`\`

Tokenize a sample text and obtain the model output:

\`\`\`python
text = "Hello, how are you?"
inputs = tokenizer(text, return_tensors="pt")

outputs = model(**inputs)

logits = outputs.logits
\`\`\`

Now, you can obtain the prediction:

\`\`\`python
import torch.nn.functional as F

probs = F.softmax(logits, dim=1)
prediction = torch.argmax(probs, dim=1)

print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
\`\`\`

## Conclusion
Transformers have revolutionized the field of NLP and continue to be a subject of active research. This hands-on example is just the tip of the iceberg, and there's much more to explore!
